# Star-wars-game

Assignment where you select one character from four choices and battle the other three. 

Each character has different amounts of hitpoints and "attack power" which both change over the course of the game.  
Characters with higher hitpoints tend to have lower attack power, and vice versa.

The objective of this game is for your character to defeat the other opponents while still having hitpoints remaining at the
end of the game.
